# C++20 Compile-time ORM Demonstration

A lightweight ORM implementation using C++20 features for type-safe database mappings with zero runtime overhead.

## Features
- **Compile-time validation**: Schema checks during compilation
- **Type-safe mappings**: Template-based member binding
- **Mock database**: In-memory testing backend


## Key Features
- **Compile-time schema validation** using C++20 concepts
- **Type-safe database mappings** with template specialization
- **Zero runtime overhead** through constexpr mappings
- **Mock database integration** for testing
